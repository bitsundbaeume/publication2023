      <p class="c-box__description">
        The second ‹Bits & Bäume› conference took place in Berlin in 2022. Once
        again, it provided a space for critical tech and sustainability
        communities to share ideas and collaborate towards the common goal of
        shaping digitalisation to foster sustainability. This companion book
        compiles the insights, work, research and opinions of more than 65
        authors with a ‹Bits & Bäume› background, including practitioners,
        researchers and activists. The articles included in this journal
        demonstrate the progress made in merging ‹Bits› and ‹Bäume› (Trees)
        topics since our first publication in 2019 by addressing different
        sub-areas of the intersections between digitalisation and
        sustainability. Encompassing a wide range of topics, the articles delve
        into pressing challenges such as the resource consumption, power
        implications and democratic governance of digital infrastructures, AI,
        blockchains, mobile apps, and other software applications, as well as
        the need to address the unsustainable practices and paradigms of e.g.,
        the platform economy. Offering not only transparency but also solutions,
        the journal presents practical approaches and concepts related to the
        necessary transformation, such as the Computer Science for Future
        programme. It also contains articles commenting on current political
        developments, such as the EU legislation on sustainability and
        freedom-related aspects of ICT devices. Further articles highlight the
        power of and need for an active civil society, aiming to inspire
        activism. This journal caters for everyone: Are you just getting into
        the topics around Bits & Bäume? Have you been involved in this field for
        many years, or are you an expert in one of the areas touched on here? In
        this journal you will find both introductory topics, such as
        illustrations on the challenges of today's digitalised society, and also
        advanced topics, such as conceptual and regulatory discussions. Whatever
        your background, we think you’ll enjoy the read, learn something new on
        the way, and get inspired. Ultimately, we are all united by the
        overarching goal of shaping digitalisation as part of a necessary
        socio-ecological change; one which contributes to a sustainable and just
        society.
