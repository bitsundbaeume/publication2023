# 1 Redefining Progress: Confronting the Challenges of Digitalisation and Sustainability

The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report has made it clear that 'the time to act is now'. Drastic action is needed globally, and in all sectors, to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and prevent an even worse climate catastrophe. In addition to the threat of human-induced climate change, the world also faces massive species extinctions while social inequalities remain severe. To address these and many other challenges, digital technologies must contribute to improving, rather than hindering, living conditions and support the conservation of climate, biodiversity, and resources. Digitalisation must be designed to support a globally just and sustainable economic system and align technology development, education, and work in a way that strengthens social cohesion. To date, however, digitalisation still has many challenges to overcome. As long as its approach to identifying and addressing these challenges is comprehensive and inclusive, digitalisation can play an important role in a socio-ecological transformation.

The contributions in this chapter are intended to provide a brief insight into the challenges of today's digitalised world. First, a chart is presented that highlights social and environmental issues arising from current forms of digitalisation. These are recurring themes targeted by Bits & BÃ¤ume. Next, our authors highlight selected challenges. Froeberg describes how your data is being used by large technology corporations to make predictions about others and how this affects them. In the article, Froeberg argues that regulation should focus more on the social implications of data. The challenge of hidden resource wastage is the topic of Petri and Ruhenstroth's article, in which they highlight the often-overlooked energy consumption of smartphone apps. Petri and Ruhenstroth present a method for measuring the abstract environmental impacts of app use and offer suggestions for reducing them. In the final article of this chapter, Robben and Hildebrandt explain why blockchain technology is part of the problem rather than the often-glorified solution to the challenges of organising society and, more importantly, saving the climate.
