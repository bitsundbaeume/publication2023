## Shaping digital transformation for a sustainable society

The second ‹Bits & Bäume› conference took place in Berlin in 2022. Once again, it provided a space for critical tech and sustainability communities to share ideas and collaborate towards the common goal of shaping digitalisation to foster sustainability. This companion book compiles the insights, work, research and opinions of more than 65 authors with a ‹Bits & Bäume› background, including practitioners, researchers and activists.<br/> The articles included in this journal demonstrate the progress made in merging ‹Bits› and ‹Bäume› (Trees) topics since our first publication in 2019 by addressing different sub-areas of the intersections between digitalisation and sustainability. Encompassing a wide range of topics, the articles delve into pressing challenges such as the resource consumption, power implications and democratic governance of digital infrastructures, AI, blockchains, mobile apps, and other software applications, as well as the need to address the unsustainable practices and paradigms of e.g., the platform economy. Offering not only transparency but also solutions, the journal presents practical approaches and concepts related to the necessary transformation, such as the Computer Science for Future programme. It also contains articles commenting on current political developments, such as the EU legislation on sustainability and freedom-related aspects of ICT devices. Further articles highlight the power of and need for an active civil society, aiming to inspire activism.<br/> This journal caters for everyone: Are you just getting into the topics around Bits & Bäume? Have you been involved in this field for many years, or are you an expert in one of the areas touched on here? In this journal you will find both introductory topics, such as illustrations on the challenges of today’s digitalised society, and also advanced topics, such as conceptual and regulatory discussions. Whatever your background, we think you’ll enjoy the read, learn something new on the way, and get inspired. Ultimately, we are all united by the overarching goal of shaping digitalisation as part of a necessary socio-ecological change; one which contributes to a sustainable and just society.
